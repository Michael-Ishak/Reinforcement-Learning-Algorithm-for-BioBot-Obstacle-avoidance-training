# Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithm-for-BioBot-Obstacle-avoidance-training
Implementation of a SARSA algorithm to avoid obstacles and allow time for self-charging for a robot designed to promote biodiversity. This is a fully autonomous robot, and this directory shows the robot training the SARSA algorithm on a generated forest environment.
